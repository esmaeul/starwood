            While we appreciate the efforts of Pidco Group in completing our
            office renovation, we feel there were some areas that could have
            been improved upon. Communication throughout the project could have
            been more consistent, and there were a few delays that impacted our
            timeline. Additionally, we encountered a few minor issues with the
            finishing touches that required follow-up visits to address. Despite
            these challenges, the overall quality of workmanship was
            commendable, and we believe with a bit more attention to
            communication and coordination,Pidco Group could further enhance
            their service delivery.

            Our experience with Pidco Group was a mixed bag. On one hand, their
            design concepts were innovative and really brought our vision to
            life. The construction team also demonstrated skill and efficiency
            in completing the project. However, we did encounter some setbacks
            along the way. There were unexpected delays due to material
            shortages, and at times, communication regarding these issues was
            lacking. While the end result is impressive, we believe there is
            room for improvement in terms of project management and
            communication to ensure a smoother experience for future clients.

            quality craftsmanship truly exceeded our expectations. From the

            process was handled with professionalism and expertise. The end
            result is a stunning space that perfectly reflects our vision. We
            highly recommend Pidco Group to anyone looking for top-notch
